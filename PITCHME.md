## Unit Testing

Unit tests not only increase quality of a product. They are an insurance to create decoupled and cohesive code. 
Design patterns, unit testing, and refactoring often work together so that the best solution may emerge.

---
### Unit Tests Should:

* test the smallest testable part 
* be short 
* test only one aspect
* be created at development time
* be independent 
* use Substitutes (stubs, mock objects or fakes

---
### Unit Tests should not:

* go outside of its class boundary
* cross  process or network boundaries
  
---
### Unit Test execution

Test execution should be automated and executed during checkins.
Developers should execute tests manually during development.
